We fell in through the clouds
And everyone before us
Is there welcoming us now
It's the end of death and doubt
And loneliness is out
Coloratura
The place we dreamed about
The melodies inside yourself
And love come pouring out
And everyone's allowed
We're feathered by the crowd
♪
And up there in the Heavens
Galilеo and those pining for the moon
Though it's a slow burn
Through Pioneer and Helix
Oumuamua, Hеliopause and Neptune
We're a slow burning tune
But we'll get there, so for now
In this crazy world, I do, I just want you

In the end, it's all about
The love you're sending out
♪
And up there in the Heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by the moon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto, Calliope, Betelgeuse, the Neon Moons
We're a slow burning tune
But we'll touch down soon, so will you
In this crazy world, I do, I just want you
♪
And up there in the Heavens
Galileo saw reflections of us too
Pluribus unum, unus mundus
And all the satellites imbue
The purple, yellow, green, red, orange and the blue
Oh, it's a crazy world, it's true
Sing it out, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
