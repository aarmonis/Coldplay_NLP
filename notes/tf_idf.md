# How TF-IDF Analysis Works

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a numerical statistic used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It is commonly used in information retrieval and text mining to help identify the most relevant terms in documents.

TF-IDF consists of two main components:
- Term Frequency (TF)
- Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)

## Term Frequency (TF)

Term Frequency measures how frequently a term (word) appears in a document. It is computed as follows:

$$
TF(t,d) = \frac{f(t,d)}{N}
$$

Where:
- \( t \) is the term.
- \( d \) is the document.
- \( f(t,d) \) is the frequency of term \( t \) in document \( d \).
- \( N \) is the total number of terms in document \( d \).

## Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)

Inverse Document Frequency measures the importance of a term in the corpus. It is computed as follows:

$$
IDF(t,D) = \log \left( \frac{M}{1 + n(t,D)} \right)
$$

Where:
- \( t \) is the term.
- \( D \) is the corpus (set of all documents).
- \( M \) is the total number of documents in the corpus.
- \( n(t,D) \) is the number of documents in which the term \( t \) appears.

## Combining TF and IDF

The TF-IDF score is computed by multiplying the term frequency and the inverse document frequency:

$$
TF\text{-}IDF(t,d,D) = TF(t,d) \times IDF(t,D)
$$

## Steps in TF-IDF Analysis

1. **Compute Term Frequency (TF)**:
    - Calculate the frequency of each term in each document.
    - Normalize the frequency by the total number of terms in the document.
2. **Compute Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**:
    - Calculate the number of documents in which each term appears.
    - Compute the IDF for each term using the formula above.
3. **Compute TF-IDF**:
    - Multiply the TF and IDF values for each term in each document to get the TF-IDF score.



The resulting TF-IDF scores indicate the relative importance of each term within the document and across the entire corpus. Terms that are frequent within a document but rare across the corpus will have higher TF-IDF scores, highlighting their significance.

## Conclusion

TF-IDF is a powerful tool for identifying important terms in documents and is widely used in text mining and information retrieval. By balancing term frequency with inverse document frequency, TF-IDF helps to filter out common terms and highlight terms that are more unique and informative within the context of the entire corpus.
